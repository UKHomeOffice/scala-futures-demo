/**
 * The Future[T] type encodes latency in the programâ€”use it to encode values that will become available later during execution.
 *
 * Future companion object has the following non-blocking apply method to create a Future:
 * def apply[T](b: => T)(implicit e: ExecutionContext): Future[T]
 *
 * Future has some similarities with Try. A Future[T] like a Try[T] completes with a Success or Failure.
 * Unlike Future[T] values, Try[T] values are manipulated synchronously.
 *
 * Alternatives to Futures:
 * - Akka: using actors
 * - Software transactional memory: using Refs, atomic and transactions
 * - Reactive Extensions (Rx): using Observable and subscriptions
 * - Scalaz Futures, and others
